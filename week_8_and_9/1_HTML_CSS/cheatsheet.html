<h1>Ruby Hashes, Arrays, Strings Integers</h1>

<section>
<h2>Hashes</h2>
A collection of key-value pairs. Can be created two ways:<br>
<code>hash1 = {"key1"=>value, "key2"=>value}<br>
	  hash2 = Hash.new<br>
	  hash2["key1"]=value</code>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
Similar to hashes, arrays are also ordered collections that are indexed by integer. However, in the case of an array, there is only one object associated with each element (as opposed to a key and value).<br>
Arrays can be created in two ways:
<code>array=Array.new<br>
array=[1,2,3]</code>
There are many methods available in Ruby that allow us to access and manipulate data within arrays.

<h2>Strings and Integers</h2>
Ruby strings hold text.

For example,
<code>"Hello world."</code> is a string.

You can use the following syntax to insert code into a string.
<code>"This string now contains the number four #{2+2}"</code>

Strings can be accessed by index. They can also be concatenated using the "+" operator.

<h2>Integers</h2>
Numbers in ruby are categorized as either integers or floats. Floats represent inexact numbers, while integers represent whole numbers.
